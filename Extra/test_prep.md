### 5.5-5.6 notes questions
 5.5
1. When you create a GitHub repository it requests a license type. Review the license types in relationship to this Tech Talk and make some notes in GitHub pages.
- Software needs a license
- Opensource -> unprotected 
- Closedsorce -> protected
- Creative commons means free and available
2. Make a license for your personal and Team project. Document license you picked and why.
GNU GPLv3 license because it is free for everybody. You wouldn’t have to worry about “stealing” patents. 

5.6 notes

1. Describe PII you have seen on project in CompSci Principles.
PII is information about a person that can be used against you. For the about me pages we had to add in information about ourselves. Everyone put in different information but it was a little summary about us.
2. What are your feelings about PII and your exposure?
It is important to know what information is out there and how that information can be used against you. I feel like social media is a big part of how I am exposed. Social media has everything from my name, where I was born, what school I go to, and my birthday. 
3. Describe good and bad passwords? What is another step that is used to assist in authentication?
Bad passwords are ones that are named after pets, dogs, or sports. Basically, anything that could be found on the internet. Good passwords are ones that are randomized and don't have patterns or anything. Two-step authentication is a good assist. It causes the user to have to confirm on a separate device to allow the first device to proceed. 
4. Try to describe Symmetric and Asymmetric encryption.
Asymmetric encryption is public where as symmetric encryption is more individual. They both can encrypt and decrypt different things like codes or texts. 
#### 5.Provide an example of encryption we used in deployment.
When someone deploys at their house their IP address is linked to it. A person can go in and search for where that person is. 
6. Describe a phishing scheme you have learned about the hard way. Describe some other phishing techniques.
Phishing for information using what is on the internet. Someone can use a person's social media to get information about a person, This can be used to find out a lot about people, where they live, what school they go to, who their friends are. This is a perfect way for a stalker to get information. 



### 5.3-5.4 notes questions
5.3 Racist HP computer

The owner thinks that the computer intentionally did not read his face because of the color of his skin. I do not think that it was intentional bias because HP has no reason to do this. I think this happened because there weren’t enough people working on the project. The group working on it could all of been white which would lead to an unintentional bias. I think it could be harmful to something to not work on you for a reason you can’t help. Although that wasn’t the goal it is still hurtful. It should be corrected because it is important to include everyone. Next time to produce better outcomes HP can use crowdsourcing to figure out the problem before putting the product out into the world. 

5.4

A type of crowdsourcing could be in our environment could be asking for feedback on a website. Although there is a chance that this could be biased there are still some ways that this relates to crowdsourcing. Del Norte crowdsourcing would be biased to Del Norte students. Although there will be more diversity because not every student is the same there is still a large bias due to the fact that they all go to the same school. This can be seen in a STATs class, they go to random different classes and ask students to complete a survey with classes. This eliminates the bias of picking the people who are taking your survey but still involves bias with the school. For my final project, I can have different students to look at our site and give input to make it better. We could also publish it online to get a bigger group of people to review the website. 

### 5.1-5.2 notes questions
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
<br>
Three benefits to computing are growing your knowledge, technology, and communication. Computing can become a distraction from the real world. This distraction causes people to lose interest in things in their everyday lives and focus more on the simulations/games. Also if you spend more time on devices it can strain your eyes. One that happens often to teens use computing for social media. This leads to bigger issues of insecurities and comparing yourself to someone online. 

2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
<br>
Dopamine is a naturally occurring thing that happens to people when they are happy. If a person is getting dopamine too much while playing video games this causes them to lose dopamine for other things. Making video games their only source of happiness. This is bad because the person will have no motivation to do other things that other people do for happiness. 

3. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
<br>
To empower yourself into a digital world it is important to stay in touch with everything. The digital world is constantly changing and improving. With it is our knowledge and education. Empowering ourselves into this world allows us to educate ourselves more. 

4. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
<br>
Something at Del Norte one can do is when you are in a classroom and see that another student does not have a device you can offer to share your device with them. This allows you both to learn as much as you can even though there is a digital divide. 

5. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
<br>
There is a lot of red tape blocking digital empowerment. Not every school and household are able to afford digital devices. This creates a huge divide between communities that have access and those that do not. At Del Norte, the school blocks a lot of websites that could potentially have educational services to them. This blocks digital empowerment because it doesn’t allow students to certain websites that could have furthered their education.
