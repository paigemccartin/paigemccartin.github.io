#### 5.1-5.2 notes questions
1. Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing
<br/>
Three benefits to computing are growing your knowledge, technology, and communication. Computing can become a distraction from the real world. This distraction causes people to lose interest in things in their everyday lives and focus more on the simulations/games. Also if you spend more time on devices it can strain your eyes. One that happens often to teens use computing for social media. This leads to bigger issues of insecurities and comparing yourself to someone online. 

2. Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?
<br/>
Dopamine is a naturally occurring thing that happens to people when they are happy. If a person is getting dopamine too much while playing video games this causes them to lose dopamine for other things. Making video games their only source of happiness. This is bad because the person will have no motivation to do other things that other people do for happiness. 

3. How does someone empower themself in a digital world?
<br/>
To empower yourself into a digital world it is important to stay in touch with everything. The digital world is constantly changing and improving. With it is our knowledge and education. Empowering ourselves into this world allows us to educate ourselves more. 

4. How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.
<br/>
Something at Del Norte one can do is when you are in a classroom and see that another student does not have a device you can offer to share your device with them. This allows you both to learn as much as you can even though there is a digital divide. 

5. Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?
<br/>
There is a lot of red tape blocking digital empowerment. Not every school and household are able to afford digital devices. This creates a huge divide between communities that have access and those that do not. At Del Norte, the school blocks a lot of websites that could potentially have educational services to them. This blocks digital empowerment because it doesnâ€™t allow students to certain websites that could have furthered their education.
